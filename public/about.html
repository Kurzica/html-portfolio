<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a self teaching student of web development, currently following  <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">Angela Yu's Udemy course</a>
   with the aim to become a web developer as a career. My background is not in computer science so starting fresh with something 
  new again is an interesting challenge, that is proving super stimulating and fun!</p>

<p>I hopefully will be updating this website to have more style and further portfolio work, should a future *fingers crossed* potential employer
  wish to see some work I have been doing in my spare time after work.
